## Hi there 👋

I’m a front-end-first full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into polished solutions. On the UI side, I create responsive, accessible interfaces using React, TypeScript, and modern CSS. On the back end, I build robust APIs with Node.js / Express and connect them to SQL / PostgreSQL databases.

My background in UX and web design, combined with years of project management experience, enables me to own features end-to-end: from sketching flows and wireframes to shipping complete solutions. I focus on clear design, clean code, and seamless user experiences.
